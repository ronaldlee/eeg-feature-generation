GAMEEMO:

freq_111_10
freq_{1}_{2} => what is {1} and {2} for?
{2} is the signal ID: (0-12, total 13 signals, not 14 channels??)
{1} is the frequency slot.



functions:
get_time_slice:

scipy.signal.resample?
 -> resample to have regular 'time' period

Skewness is a measure of symmetry, or more precisely, the lack of symmetry. 
A distribution, or data set, is symmetric if it looks the same to the left and right of the center point.

Kurtosis is a measure of whether the data are heavy-tailed or light-tailed relative to a normal distribution.

Where are eigenvalues used in machine learning?
This scaler multiple is known as Eigenvalue. Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues are key concepts used in feature extraction techniques such as Principal Component Analysis which is an algorithm used to reduce dimensionality while training a machine learning model.

An eigenvalue is a number, telling you how much variance there is in the data in that direction


PCA: week 8 (https://github.com/Ishaanidisha/Summer-W207/blob/main/Slides/Week%2008.pdf)
 -> reduce features, find the features that captures can explain most of the data?


"lag1_xxx" are the previous, then the current features..

Fast Fourier Transform

...
Simply stated, the Fourier transform converts waveform data in the time domain into the frequency domain. The Fourier transform accomplishes this by breaking down the original time-based waveform into a series of sinusoidal terms, each with a unique magnitude, frequency, and phase. This process, in effect, converts a waveform in the time domain that is difficult to describe mathematically into a more manageable series of sinusoidal functions that when added together, exactly reproduce the original waveform.
