## What is this?
This script will take EEG brainwaves and create a static dataset through a sliding window approach. Overlapping windows consider wave data and many mathematical attributes are generated in order to describe the wave. This means for Machine Learning you're not classifying point-data and thus temporal techniques such as an LSTM are no longer necessary 

The script is set to resample and generate a dataset from the csv data format exported by Alexandre Barachant's [MuseLSL](https://github.com/alexandrebarachant/muse-lsl)


## Usage
There is demo Muse EEG data under *dataset/original_data/*

Notice that there is a noise column at the end of the CSV, this would be the Right AUX input to the Muse. The script will ignore this column, so make sure you add a column of zeroes to the end.

Run the following code:

python code/EEG_generate_training_matrix.py dataset/original_data/ out.csv

python code/EEG_generate_training_matrix_gameemo.py dataset_gameemo/original_data_with_timestamps/ out_gameemo.csv

python code/EEG_generate_training_matrix_gameemo_limited.py dataset_gameemo/original_data_with_timestamps/ out_gameemo_limited.csv

python code/EEG_generate_training_matrix_gameemo_separate_files.py dataset_gameemo/original_data_with_timestamps/ output_gameemo.csv

python code/EEG_generate_training_matrix_dreamer.py out_dreamer_with_timestamps out_dreamer.csv

python code/EEG_time_domain_feature_extraction.py out_dreamer_with_timestamps out_dreamer.csv

python code/extract_time_domain_features_gameemo.py dataset_gameemo/original_data_with_timestamps/ out_gameemo_time_domain.csv

For adding fake timestamps:
python code/add_timestamps.py dataset_gameemo/original_data

This specifies the feature extraction script, where the data is stored, and where the final dataset will be output.

Class names are taken from the filename (see example data). If you would like to add custom classes, scroll down to "How do I add a new class?"

## What features are generated?
Please see [this work](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-29933-0_37) for the full description of features generated (I removed them from here because the readme got far too long!)

## How do I add a new class?
In *EEG_generate_training_matrix.py* there are the cases for mental state classes (see line 31 onwards), simply add/remove cases here and make sure they all have a unique integer state. This integer is inserted into the final column (after all features) of the class in the output

## Where do these features come from?
We have been slowly growing this list of features over time through multiple research papers.

[A Study on Mental State Classification using EEG-based Brain-Machine Interface](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8710576) - this work first proposes the technique and features. We used them to classify mental state.

## To Do
Make the final column to be ignored optional  
Add more features  
Diagrams for this readme to show what is going on a bit better
